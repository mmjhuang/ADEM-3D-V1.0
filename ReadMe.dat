2017/12/12 For 3D codes


These codes in this folder is same as those in the Book. 
The are only for 2-D particle.
The differnet between them is the number of columns in the stma (the data structures of PAI and PAJ are same as Stma) 
arrayment, becasue the finial target is to simulate non-spereical 3D particles.

1st column:  radius  (or minor axis for ellips particle)
2nd column:  density 
3rd column:  mass
4th column:  surface friction  (updated in 20171212)
5th column:  particle position in x dirextion
6th column:  particle position in y dirextion
7th column:  particle position in z dirextion (empty for 2-D)
8th column:  Young's modulus
9th column:  Poission's ratio
10th column: velocity in x direction
11th column: velocity in y direction
12th column: velocity in z direction
13th column: distance between the host particle to the local particle  
14th column: CORn
15th column: accelration in x direction
16th column: acceleration in y dirextion
17th column: acceleration in z direction
18th column: 0 for sphereical particle or host particle in an elliptical partile. Or index 
to its host particle for a baby particle in an elliptical particle.  
19th column: distance to the host particle in x-direction for 3d
20th column: distance to the host particle in y-direction for 3d  
21nd column: distance to the host particle in z-direction for 3d  
22nd column: angular velocity around x-axis  
23th column: angular velocity around y-axis  
24th column: angular velocity around z-axis 
25nd column: angular accleration around x-axis  
26th column: angular acceleration around y-axis  
27th column: angular acceleration around z-axis 
28th column: material properties for particle/ solid? liquid? wall? circle? 
29th column: Momentum for spherecal particle aodund x  axis 
30th column: Momentum for spherecal particle around y  axis    ! added 2018-06-30
31st column: Momentum for spherecal particle around z axis     ! added 2018-06-30
32nd column: space angle phi        ! added 2018-06-30
33nd columne: space angle thete     ! added 2018-06-30
34th column:  space angle psi      ! added 2018-06-30
35th column empty




space angle for ellipse particle ()

The target of this code is to put 3000 particles into a narrow tube, 
creat baby particles for those particles in elliptical shapes
and densely packed.

To avoid unreasonable overlap, huge gravity and imagine coat method is used.
